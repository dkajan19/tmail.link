**tmail.link** is an Android app that lets you create temporary email addresses using the public service hosted at [https://tmail.link/](https://tmail.link/). The inbox of each temporary email is automatically cleared every 24 hours. 

**How it works:**  
- Generate a new temporary email address directly in the app.  
- Access the inbox to read incoming emails.  
- Delete emails from the inbox manually or wait for automatic 24-hour cleanup.  

**Requirements:**  
- Android 12 or higher (uses Monet theme support).
